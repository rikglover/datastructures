1) The getNode() method is designed to return the Node in the list that corresponds to a particular
logical index within the list. In this case, what is needed is a way to get the values of the next
and prev attributes of a given node, which correspond to the next and previous links in the linked
list. Therefore the getNode() method cannot be used in this case.

2) In the case where we are deleting the last item in the list, the next field of the last node will
be null. Although we will still want to set the prev.next field to null to indicate that it is now
the last item in the list, we will not want to set the next.prev field to anything, because the next
field is null and dererencing it would result in an NPE. Because the prev element will become the
new last node in the list and it's next field has already been set to null it is not necessary to do
anything to the current next anyway so the if-statement simply checks for this condition and skips
the statement that sets next.prev = prev in this case.
