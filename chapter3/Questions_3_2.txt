1)

IntStack s = new IntArrayStack();

s.push(10);
s.push(20);
s.push(30);
s.push(40);


2)

IntStack operands = new IntArrayStack();

operands.push(17);
operands.push(0);
operands.push(-12);
operands.push(101);


3a) The starting value of top is -1 because the top variable represents the CURRENT top and when
the stack is initially constructed, there is no data in it. Before an item is pushed onto the stack
the value of top will be incremented. Therefore, by making the intial value of top -1 the index
of the first item pushed onto the stack will be 0.

** Required Refinement **

The last sentence needed to be modified to be truly correct.


3b) A final variable is one who's value can only be set 1 time. A static variable on a class is a
class variable that exists across all instances of the class. In java, making a variable both final
and static is the conventional way of defining what other languages call a "constant". Since the
DEFAULT_CAPACITY is shared across all instances of the class and it will never change it is
appropriate for it to be considered a constant.

3c) By using the prefix operator, ++top, the way that they are on line 14 the code will increment
the variable top before evaluating it. Therefore, the statement on line 14 will increment top and
then set the array location data[top] to the new value.

3d) By using the postfix operator, top--, the way that they are on line 19, the code will evaluate
the line data[top] as if there was no postfix operator (meaning it will return data[top] as the
value of the function) and then secondarily decrement the value of top as well.

3e) The isEmpty() method checks for top being equal to -1. Without this check on line 18, the attempt
to access the array location at -1 would result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because it is
not legal to access an error below the value of 0 or above the value of it's length - 1.


4) s.size() will return the number of elements currently stored in the stack. s.data.length will
return the maximum number of elements that CAN be stored in the stack without resizing.


5)

top = 4

0   1   2   3   4
______________________________________
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |


6) on the whiteboard

** Mistake using prefix operator for push as well as using super instead of this **

Also, EMPTY_INDEX probably shouldn't be a constant.


7)

public void push(int item) {
  if(size() == data.length) {
    resize(RESIZE_FACTOR * data.length);
  }

  top += 1;
  data[top] = item;
}

// I don't believe there is much of a trade off here. I believe the above is easier to read and
// less likely to be misunderstood than using the prefix operator.

public int pop() {
  if(isEmpty()) {
    throw new EmptyStackException();
  }

  int returnValue = data[top];

  top -= 1;

  return returnValue;
}

// I would generally argue against using the prefix and postfix arguments in such a way that you
// are relying upon the pre and post fix part of their behavior. It just creates opportunities for
// error. Therefore, despite its verbosity, the above is best.


8)

public static void main(String[] args) {
    IntStack s = new IntArrayStack();

    System.out.println("Starts out empty: " + s.isEmpty());
    System.out.println("Size: " + s.size());

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      s.push(i);
    }

    System.out.println("Ends up not empty: " + !s.isEmpty());
    System.out.println("Size: " + s.size());

    while(!s.isEmpty()) {
      System.out.println(s.pop());
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      s.push(i);
    }

    while(!s.isEmpty()) {
      s.pop();
    }

    System.out.println("Done!!!");
  }
}

9a) isEmpty simply compares either the size() with 0 or the top with -1. This is one step.

9b) peek simply returns the top item from the stack, which is just 1 step.

9c) pop returns the top item from the stack and changes the top index. This is 2 steps.

9d) pushing increments the top index and adds an item to the array. This is 2 steps.

9e) This simply performs a calculation that requires 1 step.

    if(newCapacity < DEFAULT_CAPACITY) {
      newCapacity = DEFAULT_CAPACITY;
    }

    resize(data.length / RESIZE_FACTOR);

  return data[top--];
