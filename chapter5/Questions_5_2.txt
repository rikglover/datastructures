1) For enqueuing, the logic is to put the item to be enqueued in the next array cell after the current
rear. Therefore, you must first increment the index for rear and then perform the assignment to the
data array located at the rear. For dequeing, the logic is to fetch the current item stored at front
and THEN increment the value of front in order to remove the item at the front of the queue.

2) front = 0, rear = capacity - 1, with a size variable

or

front = -1, rear = -1 with no size variable


3a) As long as you have a size instance variable, that relationship will always be true. When the
array is full, there will be a number elements in the queue equal to the capacity which will put
the front of the queue in the element after the back. When the queue is empty, the same condition
will be true. You will differentiate between them by the size variable.

3b) If there is no size variable the queue will need to start with the front and back set to -1. In
the event that front and back are ever equal to each other and a dequeue operation is performed the
queue needs to reset the front and back to -1; When the queue is empty an an enqueue operation is
performed the front and back need to be set to zero.
