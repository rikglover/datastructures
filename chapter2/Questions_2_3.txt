3) Because that is really just luck for the particular target and arrangement of data that happened
to be chosen. Any other target chosen would have a different outcome, which is the more common
circumstance.

4) In the worst case, insertion sort followed by binary search is a O(n^2) operation. Linear search,
however, is only O(n). Therefore, linear search is faster in the worst case.

5) See main

6) see m,ain

7) The algorithm is just slightly slower because it is testing cells that should be ruled out
earlier.

** INCORRECT **

As initially thought before actually testing it, the algorithm will not work. The reason I thought
it would work is because when I tried it it seemed to work. However, this was just luck.
